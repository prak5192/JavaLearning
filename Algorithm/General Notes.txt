Algorithm:                                                      Program
    1. Desin time                                           1. Implementation time
    2. Domain knowladge person develops it.                 2. A programmer writes aprogram
    3. Witten in any language                               3. Written in any programming language
    4. Independent of Hw and OS                             4. Dependent on HW and OS.
    5. Analyse                                              5. After writing program we do testing.
